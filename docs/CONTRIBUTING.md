First, thanks! :)

There are a few levels involved in the ns-flip project:
1. the CLI, which is this repo
2. shared templates
3. generated code bases


# Contributing to the CLI
Please open an issue and we'll work with you from there.

# Sharing Templates

## Make your Template Visible
One of our goals is to build a searchable database of templates.  We would love to include yours.  But currently, we are suggesting that you either:
1. affix the name "ns-template-" to your template name ot
2. add "ns-template" to your keyword list on npm.
That way, people can easily find you.  

Also, you can add keywords that identify the category of code being produced, such as frameworks.

## Readme
Please [create a good readme file](https://ns-flip.nostack.net/README-File) that explains clearly how to use the template. 
You need to identify what goes into their ns file, and ideally show some examples.  

## Contact Us
Please also let us know (info@nostack.net) that you have created it.

## Category
Please put into your config file a category that meaningfully identifies the type of code that your template generates.  
That way, you can create multiple templates in the future between which your user can switch without losing custom code.

# Sharing Generated Code
It is always nice to contact the template maintainer and tell them--could be that they will even include a link to you in their documentation!
